This is a game created in the context of dementia prevention. To adhere to this scenario, the game includes aspects such as quick thinking, landmarks, locational memory, reaction time, and more, to exercise the brain and help prevent dementia. I’d guess I’ve spent around >200 hours creating this from scratch, and as the title suggests, this is a project created for NCEA level 2 Computer Science, so pls report any and all bugs, and suggestions, so I can get Excellence, and it wasn’t all a waste of time! :D

Any way, this is how to play the game: 
1. Import this all into Godot, and click run.
2. Go fullscreen, and click instructions.
3. Read the page very carefully.
4. Click next.
5. Follow steps 3 - 4 until the next button is gone.
6. Click back.
7. Click options
8. Customise the game to your liking, choose between single or multiplayer, normal or hard mode, mute or unmute, and WASD and arrows or cursor for control.
9. Follow the instructions you read in the instructions section to play the game!
10. Try out different configurations, and settings, like hard mode, or multiplayer!
11. Please report any and all bugs you find, and suggestions you think of! :D


Please don’t steal this project and put it up somewhere else, for profit or something, this is intellectual property of myself (Malachi Ng) and if you steal it, you suck >:(



Anyway, idk really what else to put here, so here’s a cupcake recipe! (Let me know if it’s good I haven’t tried it)


_**Vanilla Cupcakes with Buttercream Icing**_


**Ingredients**

CUPCAKES
- 150g butter, softened 
- 1 ½ cups Chelsea Caster Sugar (338g)
- 2 eggs 
- 2 ½ cups Edmonds Self Raising Flour (375g)
- 1 ¼ cups Meadow Fresh Milk (310ml)

**Method**

Cupcakes 
1. Preheat oven to 190°C bake / 170°C fan bake. Line 2 x 12-hole muffin tins with paper cases.
2. Beat butter with an electric mixer until smooth. Add Chelsea Caster Sugar and beat until light and fluffy. Add eggs and mix well.
3. Sift in the flour, then add milk and vanilla. Beat until smooth.
4. Divide mixture evenly between paper cases, until they are about 2/3 full (don't overfill or they will form peaks). 
5. Bake for 18-20 minutes, until cupcakes are golden and they spring back when lightly pressed. Turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.


Buttercream Icing
1. Beat the butter until it is pale and fluffy. 
2. Sift in the Chelsea Icing Sugar, then add milk and vanilla. 
3. Beat until you have a light, fluffy mixture. 
4. Add extra milk if needed for a softer consistency. 
5. Spread or pipe icing over cupcakes and top with decorations as desired.
